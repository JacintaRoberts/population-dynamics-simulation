Population Dynamics Simulation Project - An investigation into the Lotka-Volterra model which captures the relationship between antagonistic species such as predator-prey and host-parasite systems through pairs of dependent first-order nonlinear differential equations.

This project was conducted in my second year of university as part of my Mathematics second major and was completed in MATLAB. An extensive report is provided which details the methods, results for each of the four tasks and a discussion to draw comparisons between each of the tasks. I was solely responsible for Task 4 which was a spatial agent-based approach of parasite model to showcase the species' interactions at the individual level by simulating a random walk in MATLAB. The "MXB261_Task4.m" script was used to document the calls to the "SpatialAgentWalk" function with various combinations of arguments to gather the results required for further analysis. To save the simulation as a video, the "writeVideo" function was used.
